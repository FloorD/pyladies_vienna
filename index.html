      <h3>Hello Vienna!</h3>
      <p>PyLadies is coming to Vienna. PyLadies as an International movement aims to provide a friendly support network for women and a bridge to the larger Python world. Anyone with an interest in Python is encouraged to participate (yes, that means guys too)!</p>
      <p>Getting started with the Viennese chapter of PyLadies, we are setting up a beginners course to Python and Django.</p>
      <p>Applications are open on <a href="">meetup.com</a>. Follow us on Twitter via <a href="https://twitter.com/PyLadies_VIE">@PyLadies_Vie</a>!</p>

    <h3>The Program</h3>
    <p>We'll then go through the Python course of Codecademy and some of the coaches will prepare a little lightning talk. That talk could be about a lot of things. It could be about web fundamentals (HTML/CSS/maybe even Javascript), it could be a bentobox exercise (borrowed from the Rails Girls program), an introduction to Git and GitHub, or the terminal...</p>
    <p>The course will take a full day, we'll split the attendees up in groups, based on level of experience. Note: this workshop is aimed at beginners, if you have never touched HTML and CSS, that's totally fine!</p>
    <p>We'll schedule a follow-up course then and there, once we see how far we can get in one day. We'll also provide you with some material so you can keep practicing at home.</p>
    <p>Let me know if you're interested in attending or coaching by clicking that RSVP-button in the right hand corner. </p>
